vision-union
============================================================

Vision Union is a _collection of computer vision workers that becomes more powerful together._

This project is a prototype and proof of concept right now.


# What ?

Image processing and 2D convolutional neural network building blocks, implemented as High-Performance C# jobs.

# Why ?

Efficient inference / service of existing computer vision models on the cpu, by leveraging Burst and the job system.
